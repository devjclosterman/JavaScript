a proxy proxyObject around the targetObject. The handler object defines the traps for get, set, and deleteProperty operations. When we access a property (proxyObject.name), the get trap is triggered, allowing us to customize the behavior. Similarly, the set and deleteProperty traps are triggered when we set or delete a property, respectively.

Proxies are powerful tools that enable you to implement various advanced features, such as validation, logging, caching, virtualization, and more. They provide a way to intercept and modify the default behavior of objects, offering flexibility and extensibility in JavaScript applications.
